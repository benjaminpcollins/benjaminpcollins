# 👋 Hi there, I'm Benjamin Philip Collins

I'm a Master's student in *Astrophysics and Cosmology* at the University of Bologna, with a background in *Technical Physics* from TU Wien. My main research interests lie at the intersection of **observational cosmology**, **galaxy evolution**, and **infrared astronomy**, particularly using **JWST**, **HST**, and multiwavelength data from ground-based observatories.

---

## 🔭 Current Research

I'm currently working on my MSc thesis using **JWST/MIRI** photometry in the COSMOS field to study **dust emission in galaxies at cosmic noon**. My work includes:

- Data handling and visualisation with `astropy`, `photutils`, and `APLpy`
- Source detection, astrometry, masking, and background modelling
- **SED fitting** using [`Prospector`](https://prospect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Creating custom image cutouts with DS9 and Python automation
- Cross-matching catalogues across multiple surveys

---

## 🔬 Past Projects

- **Bachelor's Thesis** at TU Wien on simulating surface sputtering of lunar analogue materials under solar wind ion bombardment.
- Coursework and projects involving ALMA, La Silla, and Chandra data to explore molecular gas, AGN emission, and X-ray spectra.

---

## 🌌 Interests

- High-redshift galaxies and the ISM
- AGN feedback and its role in star formation quenching
- Synergies between JWST and ground-based telescopes in Chile
- Multiwavelength data analysis and astroinformatics

---

## 📂 Repositories

You'll find here a mix of:
- Scripts and tools for astronomical image processing
- Custom `Jupyter Notebooks` for SED fitting, photometry, and data visualisation
- Notes, templates, and utilities developed during my MSc and research projects
